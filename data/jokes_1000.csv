A gorgeous petite blonde walks by, and the man immediately gets an erection.
The woman notices his erection, comes over to him and says, 'Did you call for me?'
The man replies, 'No, what do you mean?'
She says, 'You must be new here. Let me explain. It's a rule here that if you get an erection, it means that you called for me.' Smiling, she leads him to the side of the swimming pool, lies down on a towel, eagerly pulls him to her and happily lets him have his way with her.
The man continues to explore the colony's facilities. He enters the sauna and as he sits down, he farts. Within minutes a huge, hairy man lumbers out of the steam room toward him. ' Did you call for me?' says the hairy man.
'No, what do you mean?' says the newcomer.
'You must be new, 'says the hairy man, 'it's a rule that if you fart, it means that you called for me.' The huge man easily spins him around, bends him over a bench and has his way with him.
The newcomer staggers back to the colony office, where he is greeted by the smiling, naked receptionist, 'May I help you?' she says.
The man yells, 'Here's my membership card. You can have the key back and you can keep the $250 membership fee.'
'But, Sir,' she replies, 'you've only been here for a few hours. You havent had the chance to see all our facilities.'

When I got there, I was very surprised to discover that although a bout was going on in the middle of the room, it wasn't between two people, but between some fried dough in a ring shape, and a large bird that looked like an oversized chicken. You'd expect the bird to be winning, but the bout was surprisingly even-matched. Several people, including the guy who'd invited me to join the league, were sitting around the fight and egging them on.

I assumed this was some sort of pre-match entertainment, to get everyone pumped up for the real wrestling, but no sooner had it finished than another match started up between a DIFFERENT piece of fried dough in a ring shape and a DIFFERENT large bird that looked like an oversized chicken.

I was bewildered, confused, and a bit frustrated. I went up to the guy who'd invited me and asked him, 'What's all this about? I thought we'd be the ones fighting.'

He replied, 'Haven't you seen our charter? It's rule number one.' He pointed me towards a long list of rules on the wall, and went back to watching the current bout.

I peered closely at rule number one on the charter, and this is what it read:

""I'm not going in there. Fuck that."" Said the first boy.

""You pussy. I aint scared of nothing."" Said the second boy. So he slipped inside the house. He started exploring. Soon after, when started to get near the bathroom, a noise stopped him dead in his tracks.

*""If the log rolls over we will all fall in!""*

Immediately he let out a bloodcurdling scream and got out as fast as he could. He ran down the street, screaming the whole way until the noise of his screams faded in the distance.

""Wow, who's the pussy now!"" Laughed the first boy. ""He couldn't even last 2 minutes. I'm more of a man that that asshole. Watch!"" He went in the same way as the first boy, as the third boy just stood there watching. Just the same, as he neared the bathroom he heard the same eerie noise...

*""If the log rolls over we will all fall in!""*

He pissed himself, screamed louder than the first boy, and left the house yelling for his mom until he faded off into the distance.

The third boy burst out laughing at his idiot friends. He went inside and explored, trying to find what could possibly make the other two boys so afraid of an empty house. He neared the bathroom and yet again, that same noise...

Gorbachev and Reagan meet at the Grand Canyon to discuss security.

 They start to argue about who has the better personal security. Naturally, Gorbachev says that he does, and Reagan says “No”, he does. So they go outside to settle this. Gorbachev tells Reagan, “Look at this” and then orders his security detachment beside him to jump off in to the canyon. The security detachment looks at Gorbachev, takes a run and jumps (by some miracle, he is found safely hanging on a branch a few meters below them).

Reagan looks at his Secret Service man and also tells him to jump. But the man looks at Reagan and says ""I have a wife and children at home. I am not jumping.""

Shocked, Reagan walks over to the ambulance and asks the Russian man: ""Why did you jump?!""

There is not one dirty word in this, and it is funny.

The Smiths were unable to conceive children and
decided to use a surrogate father to start their family.

On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, ""Well, I'm off now; the man should be here soon.""

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.

Good morning, Ma'am"", he said, ""I've come to..''
Oh, no need to explain,"" Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, ""I've been expecting you.""

""Have you really?"" said the photographer. ""Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?""

""Well that's what my husband and I had hoped Please come in and have a seat""

After a moment she asked, blushing, ""Well, where do we start?"" 

""Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.""

""Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!""

""Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.""

""My, that's a lot!"" gasped Mrs. Smith.

""Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that."" 
""Don't I know it,"" said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ""This was done on the top of a bus,"" he said.

""Oh my God!"" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.

""And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.""

""She was difficult?"" asked Mrs. Smith.

""Yes, I'm afraid so I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look."" 
""Four and five deep?"" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

""Yes"", the photographer replied. ""And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.""

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. ""Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh ...equipment? ""

""It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.""

""Tripod?""

""Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.""

A lawyer and a redneck are sitting next to each other on a long flight. 

The lawyer asks if the redneck would like to play a fun game. 

The redneck is tired and just wants to take a nap, so he politely 
Declines and tries to catch a few winks. 

The lawyer persists, that the game is a lot of fun. 'I ask you a 
Question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5; you ask 
Me one, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500. 

This catches the redneck's attention and to keep the lawyer quiet, 
Agrees to play the game. 

The lawyer asks the first question. 'What's the distance from the earth 
To the moon?' 

The redneck doesn't say a word, reaches in his pocket pulls out a 
Five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer. 

Now, it's the redneck's turn. He asks the lawyer, 'W hat goes up a hill 
With three legs, and comes down with four?' 

The lawyer uses his laptop, searches all references. He uses the Air 
Phone; he searches the Net and even the Library of Congress. He sends 
E-mails to all the smart friends he knows, all to no avail. 

After one hour of searching he finally gives up. He wakes up the redneck 
And hands him $500. 

The redneck pockets the $500 goes right back to sleep. 

The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the redneck up 
And asks, 'Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down 
With four?'

There was a man who had worked all his life, had saved all of his money, and was a real 'miser' when it came to his money.

Just before he died, he said to his wife...'When I die, I want you to take all my money and put it in the casket with me. I want to take my money to the afterlife with me.' 

And so he got his wife to promise him, with all of her heart, that when he died, she would put all of the money into the casket with him.

Well, he died. He was stretched out in the casket, his wife was sitting there - dressed in black, and her friend was sitting next to her. When they finished the ceremony, and just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, 'Wait just a moment!'
She had a small metal box with her; she came over with the box and put it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket down and they rolled it away. So her friend said,

'Girl, I know you were not fool enough to put all that money in there with your husband.'

The loyal wife replied, 'Listen, I'm a Christian; I cannot go back on my word. I promised him that I was go ing to put that money into the casket with him.'

He lives alone, works alone, and plays his video games alone.

Now, he has tried to make friends but whatever he does...

-he always finds a person with a corrupt heart who uses him

-a person who is outright selfish and mean knowing he has no other friends

-or some old friend he's had very bad memories with

Our lonely man decides to go to a wishing well in the park, hoping the wishes are real. He tosses in a coin, and says amongst the air around him ""Please, can I have a friend who is pure and rare. Who will always be the sweetest person ever. But who I have no memories with, so I can start anew. 

Nothing happens for a minute, as expected.

As all hope seems lost, the wishing well then shakes and crumbles, and out comes a mysterious voice saying 

""Wish granted. Turn around and walk 30 yards to the fountain where you will find your wish has come true"" 

Hysterical, the man does so, and lo and behold the mysterious voice was right- there was his friend!

PENIS STUDY

Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft.  The study took two years and cost over $180,000.00  The results of the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.

After the results were published, Germany decided to conduct their own study on the same subject.  They were convinced that the results of the British study were flawed.  After three years of research and a cost in excess of $250,000.00, they concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.

When the results of the German study were released, Canada decided to conduct their own study.  The Canucks didn't really trust the British or German studies.  So, after nearly three days of intensive research and a cost of around $25 bucks and a case of beer, the Canadian study was complete and came to the conclusion that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off the end and hitting you in the face.

\[Part One\]

Dennis was the best delivery driver in the state. Whatever he was tasked to deliver arrived on schedule and in pristine condition. Nothing assigned to him was ever lost or damaged. Dennis had driven his brown truck for 30 years, and took inordinate pride in his work. Among his peers, he was a legend.   


It was Christmas time, and Dennis was nearing retirement. He had a special delivery of 20,000 loose Legos in four large plain boxes to go into gift bags at a charity thrift store. It was a late evening delivery so as to arrive after store hours, and a snow squall had come down on his route like the wrath of an ice god. A deer jumped in front of his truck, he jerked the wheel, and the truck did two full 360s and came to a stop in the middle of the road. His heart pounding, Dennis realized the back doors had swung open, and 20,000 legos lay strewn about the snowy road behind him.  


With a groan, Dennis got out of the truck and started to collect the legos. He had no intention of failing in his delivery. He spent all night collecting and counting meticulously, digging through snow and trawling the ditches to find what he hoped was every last lego. A few random motorists even stopped and helped him collect them.  


After 12 long, cold, wet hours, Dennis had 19,999 legos. No matter what he did, where he looked, or to what gods he pleaded, he could not find the last lego.   


\[Proceed to chuckle in glee, or however you react when you think you have told a hilarious joke. Wait one hour. Get people to do shots.\]  


\[Part Two\]  


Robert grew up with a wonderful dog, a golden retriever named Biscuit. Robert and Biscuit met when Robert was 8. As is the wont of golden retrievers, all Biscuit wanted to do was play fetch, preferably with a tennis ball. It started small, with low skips down the house's long hallway, then to tosses in the backyard.

Robert lived in farm country with a couple acres of mowed yard around his house. As Robert grew and Biscuit's skills improved, the fetch escalated from tosses to hard throws to hitting the tennis ball as far as Robert could with a tennis racket. Biscuit, without fail, always brought the ball back. Robert would hit the ball into a bramble and woods near his house, and Biscuit would gleefully dive in and search until he would return much later, covered in burrs, but with the ball in mouth. Robert would create elaborate bounces around the house, and Biscuit would always catch the ball on the last intended bounce, perfectly.  


Finally, Robert graduated from high school, and with some cajoling about Biscuit being a service dog, was allowed to bring him to his college. That first semester, they played fetch all about campus and the dorms, and even though Biscuit was getting older, he still never failed to retrieve the ball.   


After the first semester, Robert and Biscuit were returning home on the train for Christmas. Robert was half consciously bouncing the tennis ball off the wall of the train for Biscuit to catch, when suddenly he realized he threw the ball out a half opened window. Biscuit dove out after it. The train sped away from Robert's faithful companion of 10 years.  


An hour later, the train stopped at the station. Robert ran out of his car and started walking down the tracks hoping to find his best friend, and hoping that the fall from the train had not killed him. After an hour of walking, he saw a golden streak running towards him full speed.  


It was, of course, Biscuit, who gleefully leapt into Robert's arms. And, of course, you know what was in Biscuit's mouth.

The instructor presents them with a scenario. They are dealing with an opponent with a weapon that can be used in close range, such as a knife. On the board in the front of the room, the instructor writes, “hit it”. He then addresses the room, telling them that if the situation allows, they may need to hit the weapon out of their opponents grasp.

The class then moves on to discussing various drugs and illegal substance. The instructor notices that one of his students has fallen asleep. He calls on the man and asks, “What would you do if you encounter someone with an illegal substance or find such a substance on the ground?”

Panicked, the barely awake man looks to the board for any answers before he responds, “You hit it!”

On the way home, one of the women was passing by a dark street, when she realizes that she is being followed by a man. She tries to walk faster, but the man starts speeding up too. When the man is almost reaching her, she turns around and grabs his nuts, without even thinking.

- ""WHO ARE YOU?"" - She asks, but the man says nothing but a little muffled scream.
- ""I ASKED WHO ARE YOU!"" - She says.
- ""MhhhmmmaaAaAAA... P...P..."" - He answers.
-""WHAT??"" - She asks, without understanding what he said.

After some hesitation, the staff escorted the elderly woman to the president's office. The president asked how much money she wanted to deposit in the bank.'$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.

Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.

'Gambling' she muttered.

'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.

'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'

'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'

'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.

'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'

'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'

'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.

That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.

The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.

'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'

The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!

That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.

'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'

'Oh, nothing. Only that yesterday I bet him $100,000 that today I'd hold the president of the Canadian National Bank's balls in my hand.'",False,False,public,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/g4uaa4/an_elderly_woman_enters_the_canadian_national/,0,True,all_ads,,text,False,False,[],18233718,False,False,,True,False,,,,,True,False,self.Jokes,1587394646,long,False,self,An elderly woman enters the Canadian National Bank with a bag full of money,1,Long,False,,all_ads,21,True,False,6,1587394640,True,[],,[],False,dark,irismusic,,6,{},False,g4uaa4,,False,t2_66165117,[],0,Jokes,t5_2qh72,/r/Jokes/comments/g4uaa4/an_elderly_woman_enters_the_canadian_national/

A Florida couple, both well into their 80s, go to a sex therapist's office. 

The doctor asks, ""What can I do for you?"" 
The man says, ""Will you watch us make love?"" The doctor raises both eyebrows, but he is
so amazed that such an elderly couple is asking for sexual advice that he
agrees. When the couple finishes, the doctor says, ""There's absolutely
nothing wrong with the way you make love."" He thanks them for 
coming, he wishes them good luck, he charges them $50 and he says goodbye.

The next week, however, the couple returns and asks the sex therapist
to watch again. The sex therapist is a bit puzzled, but agrees. 
This happens several weeks in a row. The couple makes an appointment, makes love with no problems, pays the doctor, then leave. 
Finally, after 5 or 6 weeks of this routine, the doctor says, ""I'm sorry, but I have to ask. Just what are you trying to find out?"" The old man says, ""We're not trying to find out anything.

He is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.

He forced himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose!!

He sits up and sees his clothing in front of him, all cleaned and pressed! He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house.

He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: 'Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner today. I love you, darling! Love, Jillian'

He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper.

His 16 year old son is also at the table, eating. Jack asks, 'Son.what happened last night?'

'Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind you fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.'
Confused, he asked his son, 'So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??'
